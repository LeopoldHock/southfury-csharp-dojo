// SOUTHFURY CODING DOJO - 10/28/2021
// --- EXERCISE 1: Enums ---
// Enums are very handy ways of declaring simple custom types. Enums are a special kind
// of class that represents a group of constants. In the Unity Editor, Enums are particularly
// useful because they are represented as Dropdowns in the UI, which makes choosing between
// different values very convenient. Enums should always be used when a variable can have
// multiple (but finite) states!
